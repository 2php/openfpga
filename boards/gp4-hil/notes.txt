Hardware-in-loop test platform for gp4par

Requirements:
* Can fully replace official GreenPak dev kit
* EEPROM-programmed MAC address (MCHP)
* IPv6 + TCP socket based programming
* FPGA based digital I/O on every pin
* Analog I/O (>= 1 MHz) on every pin
* TCP socket based LA/DSO to interface to the I/O
* C++ -> TCP socket API to drive waveforms to the device
* Two Vdd rails, control over both (0 to 6V)
* Current monitoring on both Vdd rails at >10 MHz, ideally ~100

Nice to have:
* Several JTAG master ports w/ level shifters
* Usable as testbed for MARBLE WALRUS TCP-to-JTAG core
