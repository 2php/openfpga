\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This document is the primary reference manual for gp4par, Andrew Zonenberg's place-and-route tool for Silego 
GreenPak4 devices. As of this writing, the toolchain is NOT officially supported or endorsed by Silego and not all 
GreenPak4 devices are supported. It is under active development and should be considered alpha quality.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Architecture Support}
This guide will eventually apply to all Silego GreenPak4 devices. As of this writing the toolchain is still under early
development and only the SLG46620V is supported.

\subsection{Coding Examples}
The coding examples in this guide are accurate as of the date of publication. The most up-to-date version of this 
document, as well as source code for the place-and-route tool, may be found on GitHub at 
\url{https://github.com/azonenberg/openfpga/}.

\subsection{Syntax Examples}
The syntax examples in this guide show how to use constraints and options. The examples are comprehensive; only the 
described syntax for a particular constraint or option is guaranteed to work.

All Verilog attributes and values are case sensitive unless otherwise noted.

\section{Synthesizing a Netlist}

\subsection{Design Flow}

gp4par is NOT a synthesis tool and cannot be run directly on HDL source code. Your HDL must be synthesized to
a JSON netlist by a separate tool before gp4par may be invoked. The recommended synthesis tool is 
\emph{yosys}, which may be obtained from the Yosys website (\url{http://www.clifford.at/yosys/}). The flow of data 
between components is shown in Figure. \ref{flow}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=1]{figures/flow.pdf}
\caption{Data flow between toolchain components}
\label{flow}
\end{figure}

gp4par is being developed in tandem with GreenPak support in Yosys. Most of the GreenPak features are only available in 
the latest development version of Yosys and have not made it into a stable release yet. We recommend use of the latest 
Yosys from GitHub for testing.

\subsection{Synthesis Example}

A simple synthesis script for \emph{yosys} is shown in figure \ref{yscript}. The script synthesizes a single Verilog 
source file \texttt{Blinky.v}, with a top-level module \texttt{BlinkyTop}, to the netlist \texttt{Blinky.json} and 
targets the SLG46620V. This script is only a starting point and may be customized as needed. This document does not
cover synthesis commands; please see the online documentation for \emph{yosys} for command documentation.

\section{gp4par Limitations}

The following legal Verilog-2001 features are not supported by gp4par as of this writing:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bfseries Bidirectional or tri-state top-level module ports}\\All ports on top-level modules must be inputs, 
push-pull, or open-drain outputs. There is no support for tri-state or bidirectional outputs.
\item {\bfseries Non-scalar top-level module ports}\\All ports on top-level modules must be one bit wide. Vector nets 
may be used at lower levels of the hierarchy without restriction as long as the synthesis script includes a
``splitnets" command to convert these to single bit nets. (The synth\_greenpak4 Yosys command includes this command by 
default.)
\end{itemize}

The following SLG46620V device features are not supported by gp4par as of this writing:

\begin{itemize}
\item Storage elements: output inverter, latch mode
\item Counters: Delay, FSM, edge detector, PWM, wake-sleep mode, counter cascading.
All clock sources other than on-chip oscillator. Pre-divider value of 12.
\item Voltage reference: DAC, divided Vdd, external references
\item Comparators: Buffered input on pin 6, global buffer bandwidth selection, routing from PGA, speed doubler
\item PGA
\item ADC
\item DAC
\item PGEN mode of LUT4/PGEN block
\item Wake-Sleep
\item DCMP/PWM
\item Programmble delay line / edge detector
\item Slave SPI
\item Pin 8 reset output
\end{itemize}

\pagebreak
\section{gp4par HDL Constraints}

There is only one supported constraint entry format at this time, Verilog attributes. There is currently no support for 
adding constraints to netlist entities via external constraint files or command line arguments. The general format of a 
constraint with name \texttt{FOO} and value 42 applied to the register \texttt{foobar} is shown in Figure 
\ref{constraint}.

\begin{figure}[h]

% COUNT_EXTRACT

\pagebreak
\subsection{Counter Extraction (COUNT\_EXTRACT)}
\label{count-extract}

The COUNT\_EXTRACT constraint controls inference of GP\_COUNT8 and GP\_COUNT14 cells from behavioral Verilog. It can be 
used to ensure that a given counter in behavioral logic will, or will not be, mapped to a hard macro.

\subsubsection{Applicable Elements}
The COUNT\_EXTRACT constraint may only be used on vector registers.

\subsubsection{Constraint Values}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bfseries Vector register}\\
One of the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item AUTO: Same behavior as not specifying any constraint. Counters will be inferred where possible.
\item NO: Do not infer a counter even if the logic matches a supported inference structure.
\item FORCE: Always infer a counter. If a supported inference structure is not found, a synthesis error is produced.
\end{itemize}
\item {\bfseries Other} \\
This constraint will be silently ignored if used on any other entity.
\end{itemize}

% Coding Techniques

\pagebreak
\section{gp4par HDL Coding Techniques}

When possible, we recommend inferring design elements to maximize design portability. In some cases, such as for hard 
IP blocks or when exact control over synthesis results is required, it may be necessary to manually instantiate device 
primitives.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Counters

\subsection{Counters}

Yosys provides limited inference capability for counters which match the capabilities of the hard macro counters 
(GP\_COUNT8 and GP\_COUNT14) in the device.

Some hard macro capabilities (most notably input dividers) are not yet supported for inference; if these capabilities 
are required then use explicit primitive instantiation. Future software releases will expand the set of counter 
features which may be inferred.

\subsubsection{Inference Requirements}

In order to be inferred, a counter must:

\begin{itemize}
\item Be less than 14 bits in width
\item Count down only
\item Be initialized to the same (maximum) value by both underflow and by power-on reset
\item Have either no reset, or a positive level triggered reset to zero
\item Not have any logic use the internal counter register. Only the ``underflow" signal may be used by surrounding logic.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Counter Related Constraints}

By default, the ``greenpak4\_counters" pass will attempt to infer a counter macro for every counter matching the 
requirements. If this is not desired, use the COUNT\_EXTRACT constraint (Section \ref{count-extract}) to control 
inference behavior.

\clearpage
\subsubsection{Verilog Usage Example}

The example in Figure \ref{gp-countinfer-example} shows an example of how to infer a resettable down counter.

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{lstlisting}
localparam COUNT_MAX = 31;
reg[4:0] count = COUNT_MAX;
wire underflow_out = (count == 0);
always @(posedge clk, posedge count_rst) begin
	
	if(count_rst)
		count			<= 0;
	
	else begin

		if(count == 0)
			count		<= COUNT_MAX;
		else
			count		<= count - 1'd1;

	end
	
end
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Example for counter inference}
\label{gp-countinfer-example}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Reporting}

In order to determine whether a given counter was extracted, look at the synthesis report. Figure 
\ref{counter-extraction} shows an example synthesis report with a single inferred counter.

\begin{figure}[h]

% Shift Registers

\pagebreak
\subsection{Shift Registers}

Yosys provides inference capability for shift registers matching the capabilities of the ``pipe delay" block in the 
SLG46620/21.

The internal inverter is not yet supported for inference. If this is required for your design, consider manual 
instantiation of a GP\_SHREG primitive.

\subsubsection{Inference Requirements}

In order to be inferred as a single GP\_SHREG primitive, a shift register must:

\begin{itemize}
\item Be at most 16 bits in depth
\item Be initialized to zero (FIXME: confirm with Silego)
\item Have either no reset, or a positive level triggered reset to zero
\item Have at most two taps in the shift register connected to external logic. If more taps are required, a second 
shift register and/or discrete flipflops may be inferred. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Shift Register Related Constraints}

As of now there are no constraints to force or disable inference of shift registers. A constraint analogous to 
COUNT\_EXTRACT will likely be added in a future software release.

\clearpage
\subsubsection{Verilog Usage Example}

The example in Figure \ref{gp-shreginfer-example} shows an example of how to infer a shift register with taps delayed 8 
and 16 clocks from the input.

This section lists all of the device-dependent primitives wrapping hard IP blocks in the device. These may be used for 
features which are not yet supported by inference, or when exact control over synthesis results is needed.

Pay careful attention to port names and descriptions as these may not exactly match the Silego primitives; some have 
been changed in order to allow cleaner and more modular HDL. For example, the single ``oscillator" block is represented 
in Verilog by a separate block for each of the three internal oscillators.

Note that this primitive does \emph{not} always map to a hard IP block with \emph{exactly} 8 bit depth. The technology 
mapper may map GP\_COUNT8 cells to unused 14-bit counters in order to relieve routing pressure. In this case, the high

\subsection{GP\_SHREG: Shift Register}

\subsubsection{Introduction}

This primitive represents the ``pipe delay" block, a 16-bit shift register with programmable tap position. It has two 
major differences from most FPGA shift register blocks: there are two independent taps instead of one, and the tap 
positions are fixed at synthesis time rather than being runtime programmable.

\subsubsection{Verilog Usage Example}

The example shown in figure \ref{gp-shreg-example} uses both outputs of a GP\_SHREG in non-inverting mode. 
bar\_delay1 is delayed by 8 cycles and bar\_delay2 is delayed by 16 cycles. The output inverter is off.

\subsection{GP\_SYSRESET: System Reset}

\subsubsection{Introduction}
This primitive represents the system reset block. This is an asynchronous global reset of most on-chip logic (see the
device datasheet for exact functionality) and is independent of the power-on reset, which cannot be configured.

Note that this block has slightly different timing than the power-on reset, which may cause glitches in some designs. 
To ensure consistent behavior between the runtime reset and boot, it may be necessary to instantiate the GP\_POR 
block and gate glitching signals with RST\_DONE.

\subsection{GP\_VDD: Power Connection}

\subsubsection{Introduction}
This design element is internally used by gp4par as the source for all nets tied to a constant ``1" value. It does not 
correspond to a hard IP block in the device.

It is documented here for completeness but should never be instantiated. If a constant ``1" value is needed in a 
design, simply use the value 1'b1.

\subsection{GP\_VREF: Voltage Reference}

\subsubsection{Introduction}
This primitive represents one output channel from the device's voltage reference. It buffers and optionally divides the 
incoming voltage to drive the reference input to GP\_ACMP cells and external reference output pins.

Any number of GP\_VREF blocks (up to a maximum of one per comparator) may be instantiated. The current toolchain 
version requires that the block be replicated manually if multiple comparators are driven by the same reference. A 
future version will perform this replication automatically, allowing one GP\_VREF block to drive any number of loads.
